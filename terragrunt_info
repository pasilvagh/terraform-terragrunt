A virtual private cloud, or cloud network, is much less likely to be updated compared to individual cloud instances. For example, the instances may require software updates or changes to capacity. Although this type of resource may vary, it's crucial to understand how to establish relationships between resources that are stable, and resources that will require frequent updates. With Terragrunt dependencies, you can easily associate two separate types of resource modules within a Terraform project.

Use Terragrunt to establish a dependency between a Google Cloud Network module, and a Google Cloud Engine instance module. Once the dependency is established, you will learn how to pass data between these separate modules. The example used in this lab is straightforward by design to ensure that the typical flow of data can be illustrated.
